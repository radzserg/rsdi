// Compares a release candidate against the last released tag, so a release never ships a
// performance regression its author did not know about.
//
// Two cost models, measured differently on purpose:
//
//   - **Type cost** (`bench-types.mjs`) is deterministic. Instantiation counts are identical
//     across runs and machines, so any delta is real signal and needs no statistics.
//   - **Runtime cost** (`vitest bench`) is wall clock, and it is the weaker half. Run-to-run
//     variance on *byte-identical* code is routinely ±10%, and rebuilding between measurements
//     adds drift on top. This alternates the builds across rounds, reports each row's best
//     observation, and refuses to compare a row whose own repeats disagree.
//
//     **It resolves large effects only.** A 10x wiring win shows up unmistakably; a ~35% change
//     does not survive a busy machine, and has been observed reporting the wrong sign even with
//     the stability check passing. Treat a runtime row as a smoke alarm, and the deterministic
//     checks above as the actual gate.
//
// Both sides are measured with **this** commit's harness, overlaid onto the baseline checkout.
// Otherwise a change to a fixture would be indistinguishable from a change to the library, and
// an older tag usually has no benchmark files at all.
//
// Why not a git worktree: `bench-types.mjs` writes fixtures under `node_modules/.types-bench`
// and they import `../../src`. A worktree normally symlinks `node_modules` back to the primary
// checkout, so the fixture resolves to the *primary* `src/` and silently measures the wrong
// commit. Switching refs in place is slower but cannot lie.
