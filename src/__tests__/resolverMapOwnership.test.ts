 * flat from a few hundred up.
 *
 * Wall clock cannot guard that in CI: it does not transfer between machines, which is why
 * `pnpm bench` has no CI job and `bench:types` gates on instantiation counts instead. Map identity
 * states the same invariant deterministically — a `{ ...resolvers }` reintroduced on any of
 * these paths fails here rather than silently handing every consumer quadratic wiring back.
