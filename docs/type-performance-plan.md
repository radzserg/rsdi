Numbers are measured under `strict` via `tsc --extendedDiagnostics`. **Instantiation counts
are deterministic** and are the reliable metric; wall-clock check-time is single-run noise —
treat it as indicative only.

The repo moved from **TypeScript 6.0.3** to **TypeScript 7.0.2** (the native Go compiler)
partway through this work. Everything below was **re-measured on TS 7**; where TS 7 changed
a conclusion it is called out explicitly. Re-validate after any future compiler bump —
one finding (the crash) did not survive the last one.

---

## TL;DR

- Each `.add()` returns `IDIContainer<CR & { [n in N]: … }>`. The container type **is** the
  full dependency map, re-embedded at every link. Type-checking link _k_ is **O(k)**, so a
  chain of N adds is **O(N²)**. This is inherent to any fluent builder that exposes exact
  per-key types — not a bug in the type code. **Still true on TS 7.**
- **The fix for "thousands" is composition** (build modules independently, then combine):
  it turns O(N²) into ~O(N²/m + N) and keeps every chain short. At 1600 dependencies this is
  **~22× fewer instantiations and ~100× faster** (90.2 s → 0.9 s). Shipped as
  `DIContainer.compose()` + variadic `merge()`.
- **Fixed on TS 7:** under TS 6, one fluent `.add().add()…` expression of ~500–600 links
  crashed `tsc` with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` (AST depth, not types).
  The Go compiler handles 1200+ links without crashing — just slowly. Item 2 is therefore
  moot for TS 7 consumers and remains relevant only for anyone still on TS 6.

---

## Root cause

`IDIContainer<CR> = CR & { add; get; update; merge; extend; clone; has; … }`, and
`add` returns `IDIContainer<CR & { [n in N]: V }>`. To type-check link _k_ against a
_k_-key map, TypeScript must:

1. resolve `.add` on a _k_-constituent intersection (`CR & { …methods }`);
2. compute `keyof CR` for the `DenyInputKeys` duplicate-name guard;
3. relate the factory to `(resolvers: CR) => V` and resolve any destructured deps
   (`({ a, b }) =>`) against the _k_-key map;
4. build the next `CR & { new }` and re-instantiate the **recursive** `IDIContainer` alias.

Each is **O(k)** ⇒ whole chain **O(N²)**.

**The TS 6 crash (historical).** One `.add().add()…` mega-expression is a 500+-deep syntax
tree, and TS 6's parent-node walkers (e.g. `getAssignmentDeclarationKind`) overflowed the JS
call stack at ~500–600 links; splitting the adds into separate statements removed it. TS 7's
Go compiler does not have this limit (verified to 1200 links), so this no longer gates anyone
on a current toolchain.

---

## Measured evidence

Faithfulness check: an inlined model of `types.ts` reproduced the **real** `src/DIContainer.ts`
cost to within ~1.5% (266,569 vs 262,853 instantiations at N=200), so the model-based
ablations below are trustworthy.

### Single fluent chain scales quadratically (TS 7, real `src/`, factories reading deps)

| Scenario | Instantiations | Check time |
| -------- | -------------: | ---------: |
| N=100    |            74K |      0.06s |
| N=200    |           264K |      0.26s |
| N=400    |          1.00M |      1.63s |
| N=800    |          3.92M |      11.9s |

Instantiations quadruple per doubling — textbook O(N²). No crash at any length on TS 7
(a single 1200-link expression compiles in ~37s).

### Composition breaks the quadratic (TS 7, real `DIContainer.compose`)

| Layout                        | Instantiations | Check time |
| ----------------------------- | -------------: | ---------: |
| 1 chain of 400                |           519K |      1.50s |
| 20 modules × 20 → compose     |            97K |      0.09s |
| 1 chain of 800                |          1.99M |      11.5s |
| 40 modules × 20 → compose     |           185K |      0.26s |
| **1 chain of 1600**           |  **7,815,223** |  **90.2s** |
| **80 modules × 20 → compose** |    **361,552** |   **0.9s** |

At 1600 dependencies that is **~22× fewer instantiations and ~100× faster**. The win grows
with N, because the flat chain is quadratic and the composed layout is not.

Module size matters only for modules built from an **empty** container, where total cost is
roughly `N × size` — halving the size halves the quadratic part (m=40 vs m=80 at N=1600 differ
by ~19%). For a module **seeded** with a large declared map the seed dominates instead, and
splitting barely helps: the same 64 dependencies on a 300-key seed cost 38.1K instantiations as
one module, 37.1K as two, 36.3K as four — under 5% across a 4× split.

So ~64 `add` calls in one module is a comfortable ceiling rather than a warning sign, and
`module-seeded-64` guards it. Below that, module size is a readability decision, not a
performance one; the thing that actually costs is wiring the whole graph as a single chain.

### The `extend` pattern scales too (and keeps cross-module types)

Module functions with an explicitly declared requirement, folded with `.extend()`:
N=800 as 20 modules costs **187K / 0.19s** — same order as `compose`, versus 1.99M / 11.5s
for the flat chain. Use `extend` when a module needs a previous module's types while it is
being written; use `compose` for independently built modules.

### Field report — a real ~340-dependency application

Numbers contributed by a production TypeScript monorepo (TS 5.9.3, strict, NodeNext) that integrated
this branch. These supersede the synthetic `extend` result above, and are the reason the guidance now
says _isolation_, not _splitting_.

| Container shape                                        | Instantiations |         Types |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------: | ------------: |
| flat single chain (~340 `add` calls), published 3.0.4  |      3,489,505 |     1,268,004 |
| flat single chain, this branch                         |      3,412,439 |     1,283,956 |
| split into `.extend()` modules threading the full type |      3,482,677 |     1,296,179 |
| `compose` + leaf seeds via `Pick<FullMap, …>`          |      3,412,208 |     1,216,240 |
| **`compose` + explicit `{…}` leaf seeds**              |  **3,411,796** | **1,216,203** |

Three findings worth keeping:

1. **The upgrade is a clean −2.2%** on real code with dependency-reading factories, with no inference
   regression — consistent with the ~1% predicted for the deref-heavy case in item 3.
2. **Splitting alone does nothing.** `.extend()` modules that thread the accumulated container measured
   _worse_ than the flat chain. The win is not the file boundary, it is checking a module against a
   small declared surface: the five composed leaves cost **68.7 ms** combined versus **924.8 ms** as
   `extend` modules — **~13×** — visible in `--generateTrace`, not in the instantiation total.
3. **`Pick<FullMap, …>` as a leaf seed is a trap.** It normalises the entire ~300-key accumulated
   intersection to select a few keys. Explicit `{ a: A; b: B }` interfaces were faster _and_ decoupled.

They also report that dropping explicit module return annotations in favour of
`ReturnType<typeof previousModule>` removes the per-module depth firewall: on a stricter `add` typing it
went from 7 errors to **208**, with the container collapsing to `never`. Explicit named boundary types are
the robust choice on long chains; this is now documented in the README and the agent guide.

### Cost decomposition (per-`add`, N=400, no-deref)

| Variant                                       | Instantiations |            vs full |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------: | -----------------: |
| full `add` (guard + `Factory<CR>` constraint) |           674K |                  — |
| drop `keyof` duplicate-guard                  |           496K |               −26% |
| drop `Factory<CR>` constraint                 |           350K |               −48% |
| drop both ("bare")                            |           172K | −75% (still O(N²)) |

Even the bare minimum is quadratic. The two removable hotspots (`keyof` guard, `Factory`
constraint) only pay off when factories **don't** read their deps; real factories destructure
`CR`, so that cost is unavoidable.

---

## What does NOT help (ruled out — don't re-attempt)

- **Naive `Simplify`/`Prettify` flatten** on the accumulator (`{ [K in keyof T]: T[K] }`):
  trips TS's depth limiter (**TS2589**) at ~50 links and silently collapses inference to
  `never`. Actively harmful.
- **A recursive tuple fold for combining containers**
  (`T extends [infer H, ...infer R] ? ResolversOf<H> & Fold<R> : {}`): same failure — **TS2589
  at ~50 containers**, inference degrades silently. This is why `MergedResolvers` uses a
  union-to-intersection fold instead, which gets _cheaper_ as the container count grows
  (163K → 114K instantiations going from 50 to 200 containers).
- **Last-writer-wins _types_ for duplicate names across composed containers.** Runtime is
  last-wins, but the types intersect, so the same name registered with two different types
  resolves to `never`. Making the types match the runtime needs an order-preserving fold
  (`Omit<Fold<Rest>, keyof Last> & Last`), which is recursive per container and — measured —
  trips **TS2589 at 50 containers**, exactly the ceiling `compose` exists to clear. Identical
  types on both sides are unaffected. Kept as-is and documented: `never` surfaces a duplicate
  name instead of silently picking one, and deliberate replacement has `update()`.
- **Removing methods** (`get/update/merge/extend/clone/has`) or the **`CR &` property-access
  sugar**: ≈0% change. They're only instantiated on the final type, not per step. The cost
  is `add` alone.
- **Dropping `ReturnType<R>` for an inferred `V`** (item 3): only ~1% once factories read
  their deps. Worth doing for simplicity, not for speed.
- **Sealing/flattening the container type for consumer files** (item 4): consumers are already
  cheap (~2.6K instantiations per file, cached per program), and sealing costs ~3% _more_.
  Useful for readable error messages only — never as a performance fix.
- **An eager mapped type for `add`'s return** —
  `Add<T, N, V> = { [K in keyof T | N]: K extends N ? V : K extends keyof T ? T[K] : never }`
  instead of the lazy `T & { [n in N]: V }`. It re-maps every accumulated key on **every** `add`, so
  nested `Add<Add<Add<…>>>` re-evaluates the whole map per layer. Reproduced here: a module of **64**
  `add` calls on a 300-key seed throws 15× TS2589 on both TS 7.0.2 and TS 5.9.3, while the shipped
  lazy `&` is clean at 64, 100, and at a 500-key seed. Flatter hover text is not worth the depth
  headroom; flatten at a named boundary (`SealedContainer`) instead. Guarded by the
  `module-seeded-64` scenario.

---

## The plan

### 1. Make modular composition first-class — _the actual fix for "thousands"_ ✅ **Done**

Shipped two additions, both driven by the same type helper:

- **`DIContainer.compose(...containers)`** — a **static** method that combines independently
  built containers into a **new** container (inputs untouched). This is the documented way to
  wire a large graph.
- **Variadic `merge(...containers)`** — the existing instance method now takes any number of
  containers, so `base.merge(repos, services, controllers)` replaces a chain of merges.
  Backward compatible: single-argument calls infer exactly as before.

Type machinery in `types.ts`: `ContainerLike`, `ResolversOf`, `UnionToIntersection`, and
`MergedResolvers` (union-to-intersection, **not** a recursive fold — see the ruled-out list).
`ResolversOf` checks the `DIContainer` class branch **before** the `IDIContainer` branch,
because a class instance also structurally matches `IDIContainer`; without that ordering a raw
`new DIContainer()` passed to `compose` silently contributes `never`.

`compose` is **static**, so it needs no entry in the `containerMethods` guard set — that set
only protects instance members from being shadowed by dependency names.

- **Verified:** exact inference on composed containers, composed containers stay chainable,
  zero-argument and single-argument `compose`, raw `DIContainer` instances accepted, modules
  that declare their requirements (`new DIContainer<{ bar: Bar }>()`) compose correctly.
  Runtime: laziness/caching preserved, resolved values carried over, inputs not mutated,
  cross-module dependencies resolve, last-writer-wins on duplicate names.
- Full gate green: `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` (59 tests + type tests), `pnpm lint`.
- Measured: see the composition table above (1600 deps: 90.2s → 0.9s).

**Known limitation (documented in the README).** A module built standalone only _types_ what
it declares, so a factory in module B cannot destructure module A's dependencies with
inference unless the module annotates its requirement
(`new DIContainer<{ userRepository: UserRepository }>()`) or is layered with `.extend()`
instead. Resolution itself is unaffected — it happens lazily against the composed container.

### 2. Guardrail the single-chain crash ➖ **Obsolete on TS 7**

Under TS 6, ~500+ links in one expression stack-overflowed `tsc`. TS 7's Go compiler has no
such limit (verified to 1200 links), so no guardrail is needed on a current toolchain. Item 1
addresses the remaining (performance) reason to avoid very long chains. Revisit only if the
project ever supports TS 6 consumers again.

### 3. Constant-factor type cleanups ✅ **Done**

Replaced `add`/`update`'s `<N, R extends Factory<CR>> … ReturnType<R>` with
`<N, V>(resolver: Factory<CR, V>) … { [n in N]: V }`, and gave `Factory` an optional
return-type param (`Factory<CR, Value = ResolvedDependencyValue>`, backward-compatible). Also
dropped the redundant `& this` from the `add`/`update` return casts (internal-cast cleanup;
declared return type unchanged). Two fewer moving parts per call site; one generic instead of two.

- **Verified:** exact inference preserved (literal widening `() => 123` → `number`, `update`
  override, factories reading prior deps, duplicate-name / unknown-dep still error).
- Full gate green: `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` (42 tests + type tests), lint.
- Measured (TS 6): N=200 deref 266,569 → 263,808 (−1%); no-deref ~177K → 140,255 (−20%).

### 4. Escape hatch for downstream consumers ✅ **Done — but the premise was wrong**

The item assumed consumer files "re-derive the whole builder chain" and that sealing would cut
that cost. **Measurement says otherwise, so nothing was shipped as a performance fix.**

Consumer-side cost, N=400 dependencies built from 20 modules:

| Consumers | `typeof container` | sealed (`Simplify` flatten) |
| --------- | -----------------: | --------------------------: |
| 1         |               277K |                        284K |
| 20        |               385K |                        398K |
| 50        |               409K |                        423K |

Three conclusions, each measured:

1. **Consumers are already cheap.** TypeScript resolves the container type once per program and
   caches it; going from 1 to 50 consumer files adds only ~2.6K instantiations each. Even 10
   consumers destructuring 50 dependencies apiece (500 references) changed nothing material.
2. **Sealing costs more, not less** — consistently ~3% more instantiations, and a
   `Simplify`-based variant tripled declaration-emit time at N=400 (0.16s → 0.47s). A "faster"
   helper that is measurably slower would have been actively harmful to ship.
3. **A loose/index-signature mode is not worth pursuing.** It would trade away exact per-key
   typing — the entire point of the library — to fix a cost that does not exist.

What _is_ real is **readability**. `typeof container` and `ReturnType<typeof configureDI>` both
resolve to a type that already carries its own name, so diagnostics expand the full resolver
intersection — unreadable past a few dozen dependencies. So the shipped piece is a two-line
ergonomic helper, documented as such:

```ts
export type SealedContainer<C> = IDIContainer<ResolversOf<C>>;
```

Wrapping the container creates a _fresh_ alias, so TypeScript prints `AppContainer` instead of
`IDIContainer<{ a: … } & { b: … } & …>`. The flatten is **not** needed for this —
`IDIContainer<ResolversOf<C>>` preserves the name on its own, at lower cost than a `Simplify`
version. `SealedContainer` and `ResolversOf` are now exported from the package entry point.

- **Verified:** exact dependency types preserved through the alias, container stays chainable,
  works for both chained and composed containers, and the alias name survives into real
  diagnostics when consumed from the built `dist/`.
- Full gate green: `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` (82 tests + type tests), `pnpm lint`.

### 5. CI perf regression gate ✅ **Done**

`scripts/bench-types.mjs`, wired into CI as the `types-perf` job and runnable locally with
`pnpm bench:types` — see [type-benchmarks.md](./type-benchmarks.md) for how to read its report.
Six scenarios, each gated on a type-instantiation budget (~25% headroom over the measured value
on TypeScript 7.0.2):

| Scenario             | What it guards                                              | Measured | Budget |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------: | -----: |
| `chain-200`          | per-`add` constant factor on a flat chain                   |     265K |   330K |
| `compose-400`        | the `compose` path, 400 deps as 20 modules                  |      88K |   130K |
| `compose-scale`      | 60 composed containers — depth-limiter guard                |      28K |    45K |
| `module-seeded-64`   | 64 `add` calls on a 300-key seed — the real-module shape    |      35K |    48K |
| `update-chain-80`    | 80 same-type overrides on a 300-key seed — passthrough path |      10K |    18K |
| `update-changing-40` | 40 type-changing overrides on a 300-key seed — rewrite path |      23K |    30K |

`module-seeded-64` was added after the field report. The seed is the load-bearing part: starting from
an _empty_ container understates per-`add` cost, so an eager-mapped-type regression that breaks real
code at 64 chained calls only surfaces around 200 from empty. Both scenarios catch it now, but only
this one catches it at the size real modules reach.

**Why this is not redundant with the type tests.** The `*.test-d.ts` assertions run at three or
four dependencies. The known performance failure modes are invisible at that size — verified by
reintroducing them and running the full suite:

| Reintroduced regression                     | `pnpm test`          | `pnpm bench:types`          |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| recursive tuple fold in `MergedResolvers`   | passed, no errors ✅ | FAILED — TS2589 + `never` ✗ |
| `Simplify` flatten on the `add` accumulator | passed, no errors ✅ | FAILED — 507× TS2589 ✗      |
| eager `Exclude` rewrite on `update`         | passed, no errors ✅ | FAILED — 67K / 30K ✗        |

Every fixture also asserts exact types via a compile-time `Exact<>` check, so the gate cannot be
satisfied by making inference _worse_: a change degrading everything to `any` would lower the
instantiation count but fail the assertions. The budget path was verified independently by
lowering a budget below the measured value.

Budgets are compiler-specific. A TypeScript upgrade moves the numbers — run the script, read the
reported actuals, and re-baseline in the same commit as the upgrade.

## Appendix — reproducing the benchmark

The gated scenarios now live in `scripts/bench-types.mjs` (`pnpm bench:types`) — start there, and
add a scenario to it rather than rebuilding a one-off harness. The notes below cover the ad-hoc
exploration that produced the tables above: sweeping N, comparing layouts, and ablating individual
pieces of the type machinery, none of which the committed script does.

**Generator** — emit an N-length chain that imports the real container and destructures prior deps:

```js
// gen.mjs <N>
import { writeFileSync } from 'node:fs';
const n = Number(process.argv[2]);
let s = `import { DIContainer } from '../../src/DIContainer.js';\n`;
s += `const c0 = new DIContainer().add('k0', () => ({ v: 0 }));\n`;
s += `const c1 = c0.add('k1', () => ({ v: 1 }));\n`;
for (let i = 2; i < n; i++)
  s += `const c${i} = c${i - 1}.add('k${i}', ({ k${i - 1}, k${i - 2} }) => ({ v: k${i - 1}.v + k${i - 2}.v }));\n`;
writeFileSync(`chain_${n}.ts`, s);
```

For the composed layout, emit _m_ independent `new DIContainer()` chains of `N/m` adds each and
finish with a single `DIContainer.compose(mod0, …, modM)` call.

**Measure** — pass `--ignoreConfig` whenever a tsconfig is present and files are listed
explicitly, and pin `--target/--lib es2022` to match the package's floor:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit --ignoreConfig --extendedDiagnostics --strict --skipLibCheck \
  --target es2022 --lib es2022 --module nodenext --moduleResolution nodenext chain_200.ts
# read "Instantiations:" (deterministic) and "Check time:" (noisy)
```

Use `./node_modules/.bin/tsc`, not `npx tsc` — `npx` resolves to an unrelated placeholder
package and prints "This is not the tsc command you are looking for".

Ablation knobs used above: with/without factory dep destructuring ("deref"/"noderef");
with/without the `keyof` duplicate-guard; with/without the `Factory<CR>` constraint; layout
(one chain vs _m_ modules); and combinator (`compose`, chained `merge`, `extend` fold).
