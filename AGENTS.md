## What this is

**RSDI** — a minimal, strongly-typed TypeScript dependency injection container. No decorators, no `reflect-metadata`, **zero runtime dependencies**. Types drive the whole value proposition: resolving a dependency returns its exact inferred type, and misuse is caught at compile time.

The library is **ESM-only** (`"type": "module"`) and ships only compiled output from `dist/`.

## Commands

Use **pnpm** (pinned via `packageManager`; do not use npm/yarn).

| Task                 | Command                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Install              | `pnpm install`                                        |
| Build (emit `dist/`) | `pnpm build` (runs `tsc`)                             |
| Test (unit + types)  | `pnpm test` (`vitest --run --typecheck`)              |
| Single test file     | `npx vitest --run merge` (substring-matches the path) |
| Single test case     | `npx vitest --run -t 'merge containers'`              |
| Lint (check)         | `pnpm lint`                                           |
| Format + autofix     | `pnpm format`                                         |
| Type-cost budgets    | `pnpm bench:types`                                    |
| Runtime benchmarks   | `pnpm bench` (`vitest bench --run`)                   |
| Compare vs last tag  | `pnpm bench:compare` (release step; clean tree)       |

`pnpm lint` runs `oxfmt --check` then `oxlint --type-aware --type-check`; `pnpm format` runs the same two tools in write/`--fix` mode.

Type tests only run when `--typecheck` is passed, so a bare `npx vitest --run` silently skips every `*.test-d.ts` assertion. `pnpm test` includes it; ad-hoc filtered runs need it added back.

There is no separate typecheck script — `pnpm test` runs both runtime tests and type tests in one pass. Always run `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm lint` before considering a change done; CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pnpm build` + `pnpm lint` in one job and `pnpm test` across a Node matrix in another, with an aggregate `CI` job as the single required status check.

**Run `pnpm bench:types` too whenever you touch `src/types.ts` or an `add`/`merge`/`compose` signature.** The type tests assert inference at three or four dependencies, which is too small to expose how these types actually fail — both known failure modes pass the full 82-test suite untouched. `scripts/bench-types.mjs` checks the shapes that are big enough, and gates them on instantiation budgets; it runs in CI as the `types-perf` job. Budgets are compiler-specific, so a TypeScript upgrade needs them re-baselined in the same commit. `docs/type-benchmarks.md` explains how to read the report and what to do with each kind of failure.

## Architecture

Four small files, but the design is not obvious from any one of them.

### The type and the class are two parallel definitions of the same API

`DIContainer` (in `DIContainer.ts`) is the runtime class. `IDIContainer<R>` (in `types.ts`) is a hand-maintained type describing the same surface. They are not derived from each other.

**Every signature change to a public method must be made in both files.** The class methods return `this as unknown as IDIContainer<…>` — a cast, not a real conversion — so a mismatch does not produce a compile error anywhere in this repo. It silently ships wrong types to consumers, and only a `*.test-d.ts` assertion will catch it.

### Types are the product; the runtime is a thin map

`IDIContainer<R> = R & { add, get, merge, … }` — an intersection of the resolver map with the method set. That intersection is what makes `container.foo` typed as `Foo` rather than `any`, and it is why the whole library exists.

Each chained call widens the type parameter: `add('foo', …)` returns `IDIContainer<R & { foo: ReturnType<typeof factory> }>`. The value flowing through the chain is always the same mutated object; only its static type changes at each step.

### Dependency names live in the same namespace as method names

Because of that intersection, a dependency called `get` would shadow the `get` method. Two mechanisms guard this:

- **Compile time** — `DenyInputKeys` / `StringLiteral` in `types.ts` reject non-literal and colliding names.
- **Runtime** — the `containerMembers` `Set` below the class in `DIContainer.ts` throws `ForbiddenNameError`.

That `Set` is **derived**, built once at module load from the class itself:

```ts
const containerMembers = new Set([
  ...Object.getOwnPropertyNames(DIContainer.prototype),
  ...Object.getOwnPropertyNames(new DIContainer()),
]);
```

so adding a member reserves its name automatically. It was a hand-written list until 3.4.0, and the list was wrong three ways: `export` was missing until a dependency of that name was found to break every `merge`; `setValue`/`addContainerProperty` were explicitly (and wrongly) permitted; and instance fields were never considered at all. Don't put it back. Three things it encodes:

- **Non-public prototype members are reserved too, and must be.** `addContainerProperty` defines dependencies as _own_ properties, which shadow the prototype methods the class calls through `this` — a dependency named `setValue` registers fine and makes the _next_ `add` throw `TypeError: this.setValue is not a function`.
- **The throwaway instance is not decoration.** Fields (`resolvers`, `resolvedDependencies`, `context`) exist nowhere until one is constructed, and they are own properties before any dependency is registered — so `addContainerProperty`'s `Object.hasOwn(this, name)` early-return skipped wiring the getter entirely. `add('resolvers', …)` used to half-work: `get('resolvers')` resolved, while `container.resolvers` handed back the container's own internal map.
- **Read `DIContainer.prototype`, never `Object.getPrototypeOf(this)`.** A subclass (`ClonedDiContainer`, or a consumer's) must not change which names are reserved, because the types describe `DIContainer` alone.

Static members (`DIContainer.compose`) live on the constructor, never the instance, so a dependency cannot shadow them and they are correctly absent. Inherited `Object.prototype` names are absent too, and need no reserving — see the next section.

### Both internal maps are null-prototype

`resolvers` and `resolvedDependencies` are `Object.create(null)`, not `{}`. `get()` reads them with plain property lookups, so with an ordinary object a dependency named after an `Object.prototype` member resolved to the inherited function: `add('toString', () => 'a value')` registered fine and then returned `[Function: toString]`, because `resolvedDependencies.toString !== undefined` short-circuits the cache check.

Guarding each lookup with `Object.hasOwn` would fix it and tax every cache hit; dropping the prototype fixes it and taxes nothing — these maps are built a key at a time and so sit in V8's dictionary mode either way. Measured on the `resolve.bench.ts` rows, the only ones tight enough to judge (rme ±0.15%), it came out slightly _faster_. **Don't reintroduce `{}` for either map**; `reservedNames.test.ts` pins the behaviour.

`export()` is the exception and stays ordinary — its copies are handed to consumers, not used for lookup.

### Mutation is real; immutability is only in the types

`add`, `update`, and `merge` all mutate `this` and return it re-cast — `merge` writes into `this.resolvers` and returns `this`. `clone()` and the static `DIContainer.compose()` are the only ways to get a genuinely separate instance; `compose` builds a fresh container and merges each input into it, leaving the inputs untouched.

`clone()` works through `ClonedDiContainer`, a non-exported subclass at the bottom of `DIContainer.ts`. It exists purely to provide a constructor that seeds resolvers, because the public `DIContainer` constructor deliberately takes no arguments. `setResolvers` is `protected` for the same reason and throws if resolvers already exist.

**No two containers may share a resolver map.** `add`, `update` and `merge` write into `this.resolvers` in place — that is what keeps a chain linear instead of quadratic — so `setResolvers` has to copy what `clone()` hands it. Adopting the source's map instead would leak every later registration back into it in both directions. Three tests in `clone.test.ts` pin this; they are the reason the in-place writes are safe.

Those writes cost a chain of 1600 dependencies 196 ms before and 0.6 ms after, so **treat a rebuild of either map as a performance bug, not a style choice.** Wall clock can't guard that in CI, so `resolverMapOwnership.test.ts` asserts the maps keep their identity across `add`, `update`, `merge` and a cached `get` — the same invariant, stated deterministically. A `{ ...this.resolvers }` anywhere on those paths fails there.

**`export()` is the one place that copies on purpose.** Before the in-place writes, `add` replaced `this.resolvers` outright, so what `export()` returned was a de-facto snapshot; handing out the live map now would let a caller watch the container change under them and mutate it by writing into what they were given. Nothing inside the class calls it — `clone()` and `merge()` read the protected maps directly, cross-instance — so no internal path pays for the copy. Note `export` is declared on the class but **not** on `IDIContainer`, so it is unreachable once a chain has widened the type; if that is ever fixed, fix it in both files.

### Resolution: lazy, cached, via two access paths

`get(name)` and property access (`container.name`) reach the same cache. Property access is wired by `addContainerProperty`, which `Object.defineProperty`s a getter delegating to `get()` as each resolver is registered.

Factories receive `this.context`, a `Proxy` built in the constructor that forwards property reads back to the container — that is what makes `.add('foo', ({ a, bar }) => …)` destructuring resolve dependencies lazily at call time rather than at registration time.

`update()` must delete the cached value for the name it replaces; without that, a container that had already resolved the dependency keeps returning the stale instance. This was a real bug fixed in 3.1.0.

### `update` is the one method that can't widen lazily

`add` appends with an intersection, which TypeScript never has to normalise. `update` _replaces_, and `{ a: A } & { a: B }` is `A & B` rather than `B` — so it has to rewrite the resolver map, and a rewrite per link makes a chain O(depth × container-size). That tripped `TS2589` at 50 chained calls on a 300-key container, in exactly the shape a test harness produces.

`UpdatedResolvers` in `types.ts` avoids the rewrite in the case that actually chains: when the replacement's type is _mutually assignable_ with the one already registered — a test double for the real service — the container type passes through unchanged. The check has to be mutual, not one-way; one-way would also swallow the subtype case, which is supposed to narrow the container type. `bench-types.mjs`'s `update-chain-80` scenario fails with `TS2589` if the shortcut is removed.

Note this is a _type_-level cost only. The runtime `update()` path is the same in-place `setValue` write `add` uses, and `resolverMapOwnership.test.ts` covers it.

## Runtime benchmarks

`pnpm bench` runs `src/__tests__/__benchmarks__/*.bench.ts` through `vitest bench`, pricing the runtime claims above: cache hits are flat in container size, wiring is linear, `compose` adds nothing. **Read each group as ratios between its own rows** — wall clock does not transfer between machines, so there are no budgets and no CI job (`docs/type-benchmarks.md` explains why).

**A benchmark body must not repeat one loop-invariant call.** Resolving a fixed name in a batch lets V8 hoist the call clean out of the loop, so the row measures the optimiser instead of the container — that artefact reported a 2.7x speedup here as a 1.6x regression, in both directions, reproducibly. Vary the name per iteration, as `resolve.bench.ts` does.

**`pnpm bench:compare` is the one place these numbers become a verdict.** It builds the last released tag and the current checkout, measures both with _this_ checkout's harness, and reports the deltas; the `/release` skill runs it before the CHANGELOG is written. Two things it encodes that are easy to get wrong by hand:

- **It skips the runtime section when the compiled `dist/*.js` is identical bar comments.** That is a stronger claim than any timing run, and it is how a types-only release avoids reporting noise as a result. The check is `-maxdepth 1` deliberately — `tsc` also emits `dist/__tests__/**`, and folding that in makes every test-only edit look like a runtime change.
- **It alternates the two builds across rounds and keeps the best observation of each.** One unalternated pair is not enough: during development this exact harness reported a confident `+47.6%` regression on `get()`, a path that is roughly 4x _faster_. Two rounds put it at `-26.8%`. `BENCH_COMPARE_ROUNDS` raises it when a flag looks marginal.

**Its runtime half resolves large effects only, and says so.** Rows whose own repeats disagree print as `unstable — not compared`, which means unjudged rather than clean. Even a row that passes the stability check has been seen reporting the wrong sign on a ~35% change while the machine was busy. The deterministic halves — type cost and the compiled-output check — are the actual gate; the timings are a smoke alarm.

## Conventions & gotchas (read before editing)

- **Single quotes, canonical style.** Formatting is owned by `oxfmt` (`.oxfmtrc.json`: single quotes, 2-space indent, 100-col print width, trailing commas); lint rules come from `oxlint-config-canonical` via `oxlint.config.ts`. Do **not** reformat with double quotes. If in doubt, run `pnpm format`. The pre-commit hook (`lint-staged`) runs `oxfmt` on staged `*.{ts,json,md,yml,yaml}` and `oxlint --fix` on staged `*.ts`, so non-conforming formatting gets silently rewritten on commit. Both commands carry `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern`; without it, a commit touching only files one tool can't handle (JSON for oxlint, `pnpm-lock.yaml` for oxfmt) fails the hook with "no files found".

- **Two different Node versions, on purpose.** `engines.node >=16.9.0` is what the _published_ package needs at runtime; `devEngines.runtime >=22` and `.nvmrc` (26) are what _contributing_ needs. They are unrelated audiences, so the mismatch is correct — don't "fix" it by aligning them. `devEngines` is enforced by npm 11+ and pnpm 11 when installing this repo and ignored when the package is consumed as a dependency.

  Its value is squeezed from three directions, and getting it wrong breaks installs in ways that look nothing like a version problem:
  - **At or above what pnpm itself needs.** pnpm 11.17.0 declares `engines.node >=22.13`, and its launcher hard-exits (`ERROR: This version of pnpm requires at least Node.js v22.13`, exit 1) below that — so a lower `devEngines` would wave through a contributor who then cannot run a single repo command. Re-check this when bumping `packageManager`.
  - **A subset of the range the native bindings declare.** oxfmt, oxlint, and rolldown ship their binaries as optional dependencies with `engines: ^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`, and pnpm skips an optional dependency unless _every_ version in the declared range satisfies it. `>=22` looks harmless but admits 22.0–22.11, so pnpm silently drops the platform binding — 137 packages install instead of 140 — and every command dies with `Cannot find native binding` / `Cannot find module '@oxfmt/binding-linux-x64-gnu'`. A local install won't reveal it if `node_modules` already exists; reproduce with a clean install in a container.
  - **At or below the lowest entry in the CI test matrix**, or the matrix's own `pnpm install` fails.

  `>=22.13.0` satisfies all three today.

- **The floor is 16.9.0 because of `Object.hasOwn`**, which `DIContainer` uses in four places and which landed in 16.9 — not 16.0. Because development happens on Node 26, nothing about day-to-day work would reveal a newer built-in sneaking in, so two guards exist:
  - `tsconfig` pins `target` and `lib` to `ES2022`, the match for Node 16.9. A post-ES2022 API is then a compile error rather than a runtime failure at a consumer. Raising the floor means raising these together.
  - The `min-node` CI job imports the built package under a `node:<floor>-alpine` container, with the tag derived from `engines.node` so the check can't drift from the declaration. It keeps every component the floor declares — `16.9.0`, not `16.9` — because a partial tag floats to the newest patch in that line and would quietly test above the floor. The script is `scripts/smoke-min-node.mjs`; keep it dependency-free, since it runs against nothing but the floor's built-ins.

  This has gone wrong once already: 3.1.1 shipped `Object.hasOwn` with `engines` unset, and every `has()` call threw for anyone below 16.9.

- **ESM-only, so relative imports carry the `.js` extension** even in `.ts` source (`./types.js`, not `./types`). `moduleResolution` is `NodeNext`.

- **Type tests are real assertions.** In `*.test-d.ts`, always use `expectTypeOf(value).toEqualTypeOf<T>()` (exact equality). Do **not** use the bare `expectTypeOf<T>(value)` form — it only checks assignability and silently misses widened/incorrect types. Type tests run only under `--typecheck` (already wired into `pnpm test`).

- **Keep runtime dependencies at zero.** Never add a `dependencies` entry. Dev-only tooling goes in `devDependencies`.

- **Resolvers are lazy and cached.** `add(name, factory)` registers a factory; it runs once on first `get`/property access, then the result is cached. `add` throws if the name already exists — use `update` to replace (mainly for test mocking). Reserved container method names (`add`, `get`, `merge`, …) cannot be used as dependency names.

- **Composition is the answer to slow type-checking, and it is load-bearing.** A single `.add()` chain of N dependencies costs O(N²) to check (1600 deps ≈ 90 s); the same graph split into modules and combined with `DIContainer.compose()` checks in under a second. `MergedResolvers` in `types.ts` deliberately uses a union-to-intersection fold — a recursive tuple fold trips TS2589 at ~50 containers and silently degrades inference to `never`. Likewise `ResolversOf` must test the `DIContainer` class branch **before** the `IDIContainer` branch, since a class instance also matches `IDIContainer` structurally. Both constraints are covered by type tests; see `docs/type-performance-plan.md` for the measurements.

## Toolchain pins (don't casually bump)

- **Linting is oxlint-only — no ESLint.** `oxlint` + `oxfmt` + `oxlint-config-canonical` replaced the ESLint/prettier stack; type-aware rules need `oxlint-tsgolint` installed (it is a devDependency, invoked via `--type-aware --type-check`).
- **TypeScript is on v7** (the native compiler). `tsc` now ships as a platform-specific Go binary via optional deps, so the lockfile carries every platform's package — don't prune them. `pnpm peers check` reports an unmet `typescript` peer from `@typescript-eslint/utils`, pulled in transitively by `oxlint-config-canonical` → `eslint-plugin-perfectionist`; it is unused (oxlint implements those rules natively) and the warning is safe to ignore.
- **Vitest is pinned exactly** (no `^`) because `--typecheck` is still flagged experimental.
- **pnpm settings live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`**, not the `pnpm` field in `package.json` (pnpm 11 no longer reads that field). Build scripts are approved via `allowBuilds`.
- pnpm 11 enforces a **supply-chain `minimumReleaseAge` policy**: very freshly published versions can be rejected at install. If an install fails on a just-released package, pin to a slightly older version rather than disabling the policy.

## Publishing

- `prepublishOnly` runs `pnpm build`, so `dist/` is always fresh on publish.
- `files` publishes `dist/**` but excludes `dist/**/__tests__/**` — compiled tests are not shipped. It also ships `docs/ai-agent-guide.md`, so an AI agent working in a consumer's project can read the integration guide straight out of `node_modules`; that file is the only doc that ships, so any link in it to another doc must be an absolute GitHub URL rather than a relative path.
- License is **Apache-2.0** (matches the `LICENSE` file).

- **The package is ESM-only and that is deliberate**, not a limitation — nothing in `src/` requires it (no `import.meta`, no top-level await). CommonJS consumers are not shut out: Node 20.19+ and 22.12+ resolve `require()` of an ESM package, so the effective floor for a CJS consumer is Node 20.19 even though `engines.node` says 16.9. TypeScript CJS consumers need `module: nodenext`; on `Node16` they get `TS1479`. Dual-publishing CJS has been considered and rejected — it doubles the build and invites the dual package hazard, where two loaded copies make `instanceof DIContainer` fail.

- **`exports` condition order is significant.** `types` must stay before `default`, or TypeScript resolves the runtime entry and consumers lose every type. `oxfmt` preserves the order today, but nothing enforces it — if you reorder the block, re-check that a consumer on `moduleResolution: nodenext` still gets inference. The map also blocks deep imports (`rsdi/dist/…` now throws `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`), which is the point: `dist/` layout is not API. `main`/`types` stay alongside it for resolvers that predate `exports`.
